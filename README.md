Note: This was a group project made during a local Hackathon in Redmond.

This project presents a helium leak detector for spaceships that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze visual patterns from Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) cameras. By combining advanced machine learning with practical applications in space technology, this work is to focus on my passion for both physics and computer science

Though we couldn't get access to much training data, we decided to make a ML Model that bases itself off CNN to model. This was one of our parts the team's project in the EmP Hackfest Competition to win First Place prize!
